# Lego-Unit-Converter
This tool works to convert the specified length and width (MM, CM, M, Feet, Inches) into lego studs! 

## About The Project
I would say that Lego building is a hobby I have and enjoy so this tool was something I could see myself being able to create as a first project as a new web developer. This project was created as my submission for an assignment in the web development program at Humber College. 

## How To Use
To use just clone the repo and follow the instructions when opening the index.html file! Its fairly simple, just select the desired unit of measure and input the length and width then just hit the convert button to see the output!

## Whats Next?
Ideally as my skills improve I would like to add an api that has a list of many lego pieces that I could somehow use to show what would fit in the calculated area!
